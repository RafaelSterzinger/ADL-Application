This project is a complementary web-application to the Applied-Deep-Learning project.

To start the web-application run the following commands in your directory:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Afterwards the website will be hosted at **localhost:3000**.

To use the trained model to predict your stock data, execute the **server.py** file from the Applied-Deep-Learning project to start the backend.
